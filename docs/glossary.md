# Glossary

**API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications. In the context of LLMs, an API allows you to interact with a language model hosted by a provider.

**Embeddings:** Numerical representations of text that capture their meaning and semantic relationships. Embeddings can be used for tasks like semantic search, clustering, and recommendation.

**Functions:** Specific actions or operations that can be performed by an LLM. The LLM Interface may allow you to define custom functions or utilize pre-defined functions offered by providers.

**LLM (Large Language Model):** A type of artificial intelligence model trained on a massive dataset of text and code. LLMs can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

**LLM Interface:** This Node.js module that provides a standardized way to interact with various LLM providers' APIs.

**Provider:** The company or organization that offers a language model API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic).

**Interface Name:** The specific string used within the LLM Interface package to identify and access a provider's API (e.g., 'openai', 'cohere', 'anthropic').

**Model:** The specific string used to reference a LLM offered by a provider (e.g., 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'command-nightly').

**Native JSON Mode:** A communication mode where the LLM directly parses and responds with JSON objects, facilitating structured data exchange and function calling.

**Prompt:** The input given to an LLM, which can be a question, instruction, or piece of text.

**Response:** The output generated by an LLM in response to a prompt.

**Streaming:** A feature that allows you to receive the LLM's response as it is being generated, rather than waiting for it to be fully completed.

**Token:** The basic unit of text used by LLMs. Tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the specific model. Token usage can affect pricing in some LLM APIs.

**Tools:** External resources or functionalities (e.g., calculators, code interpreters, search engines) that can be integrated with LLMs to enhance their capabilities.
