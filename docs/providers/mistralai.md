## Interface Name

- `mistralai`


## Model Aliases

The following model aliases are provided for this provider. 

- `default`: mistral-large-latest
- `large`: mistral-large-latest
- `small`: mistral-small-latest
- `agent`: mistral-large-latest

## Embeddings

- `default`: mistral-embed
- `large`: mistral-embed
- `small`: mistral-embed


## Options

The following values can be passed through `options`.

- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `random_seed`: _Details not available, please refer to Mistral AI documentation._
- `response_format`: Defines the format of the AI's response. Setting this to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, ensuring the message generated by the model is valid JSON.
- `safe_prompt`: _Details not available, please refer to Mistral AI documentation._
- `stream`: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, similar to ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the output more focused and deterministic. Generally, it is recommended to alter this or top_p, but not both.
- `top_p`: Controls the cumulative probability of token selections for nucleus sampling. It limits the tokens to the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. It is recommended to alter this or temperature, but not both.


## Features

- Native JSON Mode: true
- Streaming: true
- Embeddings: true
